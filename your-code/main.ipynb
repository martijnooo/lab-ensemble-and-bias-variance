The key idea here is that the errors in each individual model are somewhat independent because they are trained on different bootstrap samples.

The key idea behind boosting is to incrementally improve the model by correcting errors, which helps to reduce bias, especially when the initial model is too simple and underfits the data.\n",

    "- Boosting typically uses weak learners, which are models that perform only slightly better than random guessing. For example, in classification, a weak learner might be a shallow decision tree (a \"stump\") with just a few levels. Weak learners usually have high bias, meaning they are too simplistic and don't capture the underlying patterns in the data well. As a result, they underfit the data.\n",

    "- In each iteration, boosting trains a new model that tries to correct the errors made by the earlier models. If an instance was misclassified by the first weak learner, it will receive a higher weight, so the next model pays more attention to it. As the sequence of models progresses, the ensemble collectively focuses more on the difficult-to-predict instances. Over time, the combined models become better at fitting the data, as they successively reduce the bias (systematic error) by adjusting for earlier mistakes."
