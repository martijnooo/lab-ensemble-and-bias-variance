# Lab | Ensemble and Bias Variance

## Introduction

In this lab, we are going to explore how ensembling can help us manage the bias-variance tradeoff. 

## Getting Started

Open the `ipynb` file in `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how ensembling can be a powerful tool to reduce variance and bias significantly in your ML workflows.

## Deliverables

- `ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
